# Fallback Images

This directory contains static fallback images for Lottie animations when:
- User has reduced motion preferences enabled
- Lottie files fail to load
- JavaScript is disabled

## Required Fallback Images

1. `neural-fallback.svg` - Neural network pattern
2. `data-fallback.svg` - Data flow visualization  
3. `particles-fallback.svg` - Abstract particle pattern

These should be simple, static SVG files that represent the theme of their corresponding Lottie animations.
